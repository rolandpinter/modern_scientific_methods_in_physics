# Info

This repository is for holding my assignments for a university course called Modern Scientific Methods in Physics 1 (Korszerű Számítástechnikai módszerek a fizikában 1.).

# big_project

- Files
  - CMakeLists.txt: as the name suggests, it's just the cmake list :)
  - main.cpp: main event handler of the project
  - stat.cpp, stat.hpp: source and header file containig the _statistics_ class and all the helper functions
- How to build the project
  - Step 1: clone the repository
  - Step 2: build using the provided CMakeLists.txt file
- Functionalities
  - The program generates N random float numbers in a given range and makes available the use of the following statistical analysis tools:
    - compute the mean of the data sequentially (using only STL algos) and parallel (using threads) and measure the execution times
    - compute the deviation of the data sequentially (using only STL algos) and parallel (using threads) and measure the execution times

# hw1_Newton_iterator

First short homework, performs Newton iteration with template functions

# hw2_vector2

Second short homework, template class for 2 dimensional vectors with some operations

# hw3_numerical_differentiation

Third short homework, which is aimed to learn about numerical differentiation
